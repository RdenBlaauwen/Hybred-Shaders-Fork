# Hybred Shaders - ReShade anti-aliasing

I recommend for single player games that you use [REST addon](https://github.com/4lex4nder/ReshadeEffectShaderToggler/releases) \
in order to ignore the UI of the game.

Also recommended to pair this with a post-process AA like [SMAA from MartyMCModding](https://github.com/martymcmodding/iMMERSE) or [CMAA2 also from MartyMCModding](https://gist.github.com/martymcmodding/aee91b22570eb921f12d87173cacda03). Make sure other AA methods go before (above) this shader.
